# VirtualForests

The Virtual Forests Ontology includes all the vocabulary needed to describe Virtual Forests and REINFFORCE datasets using 
[W3C RDF Schema (RDFS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) and [W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/). 
The vocabulary provides data publishers to include detailed metadata about species taxonomy and their different provenances, 
specialization, arboretum sites, location, climatic conditions, survival and growth rates of trees.
